## Choosing Stocks for Growth

🕒 *Estimated Time: 15 minutes*

No strategy guarantees gains; past performance does not predict future results. Below are principles and factors often used when screening for **growth-oriented** stocks—stocks where the goal is to maximize upside over time.

## Frameworks and Principles

### 📈 What “Maximize Gains” Usually Means

- **Growth investing**: Focus on companies with strong revenue or earnings growth, often trading at higher valuations (e.g. higher P/E). Goal is price appreciation.
- **Momentum**: Favor names that have already been rising (price or relative strength). *Momentum can reverse quickly.*
- **Quality + growth**: Combine growth with strong balance sheets, margins, and cash flow to reduce risk while aiming for upside.

### 🔍 Fundamental Factors to Consider

- **Revenue and earnings growth**: Look at year-over-year and multi-year trends. Sustained growth often supports higher valuations.
- **Profitability and margins**: Gross margin, operating margin, and net margin show pricing power and efficiency. Improving margins can signal strength.
- **Balance sheet**: Low or manageable debt, solid cash, and positive free cash flow reduce risk of dilution or distress.
- **Valuation**: Metrics such as P/E, PEG (P/E relative to growth), and P/S help compare growth vs. price. *High growth can justify higher multiples; very high multiples leave less room for error.*

### 📊 Data and Screening

- **Screeners**: Use screeners (e.g. by sector, market cap, growth rate, valuation) to narrow the universe. Filter by revenue growth, earnings growth, and debt levels.
- **Financial statements**: Review 10-K and 10-Q (SEC filings) or equivalent for cash flow, debt, and management discussion.
- **APIs and datasets**: Market and fundamental data can be pulled via APIs (e.g. [**Marketstack**](https://marketstack.com/): stock data in JSON. **Register for API key.**) or similar services for building your own screens and dashboards.

### ⚠️ Risk and Behavior

- **Diversification**: Concentrating in a few high-growth names increases volatility and drawdown risk. Spreading across sectors and names can smooth returns.
- **Time horizon**: “Maximizing gains” over a short period is closer to speculation. Longer horizons align better with fundamental growth and compounding.
- **Discipline**: Define entry/exit rules or rebalancing so emotion does not drive all decisions. Avoid chasing after big moves if your process does not support it.
